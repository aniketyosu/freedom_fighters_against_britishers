        <h2>Veer Narayan Singh (1795–1857)</h2>
        <p>
          Veer Narayan Singh, a landlord from Sonakhan, Chhattisgarh, was the
          first martyr from the region in the 1857 revolt against British rule.
          He led a rebellion with 500 men and was executed at Jaistambh Chowk in
          Raipur. His sacrifice made him a tribal leader and a symbol of
          resistance in Chhattisgarh.
