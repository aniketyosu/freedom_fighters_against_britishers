        <h2>Birsa Munda (1875–1900)</h2>
        <p>
          Birsa Munda, born in Ulihatu, was a tribal leader who led the Ulgulan
          movement against British rule. He aimed to establish Munda Raj and
          fought against the exploitation of tribal communities. His efforts led
          to the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act, protecting tribal land rights. Birsa
          Munda remains a revered figure in Jharkhand's history.

        <h2>Sidhu Murmu (c.1815–1856) & Kanhu Murmu (c.1820–1856)</h2>
        <p>
          Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu were brothers who led the Santhal Rebellion in
          1855–56 against British colonial authority and the oppressive
          zamindari system. Mobilizing around 10,000 Santhals, they challenged
          British forces in present-day Jharkhand. Though the rebellion was
          suppressed, it remains a significant chapter in India's freedom
          struggle.

          eventually captured and executed, but his legacy endures.

          forces and collaborated with other leaders to challenge colonial

          to Jharkhand's contribution to India's independence.

        <p>
          Nana Tana Bhagat was a freedom fighter from the Ranchi district who

          of tribal communities. His efforts contributed to the broader struggle
          against British colonialism in Jharkhand.
