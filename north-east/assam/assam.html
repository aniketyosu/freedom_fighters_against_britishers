          <p>
            Maniram Dewan was a prominent Assamese nobleman and the first Indian
            tea planter. Deeply involved in the 1857 uprising, he was arrested
            and hanged by the British for his role in the rebellion. His
            martyrdom is a significant chapter in Assam's history.
