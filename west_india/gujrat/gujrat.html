        <h2>Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948)</h2>
        <p>
          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, born in Porbandar, Gujarat, was the
          foremost leader of India's independence movement. He pioneered the
          philosophy of nonviolent resistance, leading nationwide campaigns
          against British colonial policies. His leadership in movements like
          the Salt March and Quit India galvanized millions, making him a global
          symbol of peaceful protest. Gandhi's unwavering commitment to truth
          and justice laid the foundation for India's freedom and inspired civil
          rights movements worldwide.

        <h2>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (1875–1950)</h2>
        <p>
          Hailing from Nadiad, Gujarat, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was a key
          figure in India's fight for independence and later, its unification.
          Known as the 'Iron Man of India,' he played a pivotal role in
          organizing peasants in nonviolent civil disobedience against British
          policies. Post-independence, Patel was instrumental in integrating
          over 500 princely states into the Indian Union, ensuring the nation's
          unity and integrity.

          colonial policies and the exploitation by local elites, leading a
          series of rebellions. Makrani's defiance culminated in his execution
