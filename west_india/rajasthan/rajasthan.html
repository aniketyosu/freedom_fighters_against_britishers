        <h2>Pandit Arjun Lal Sethi (1880–1941)</h2>
        <p>
          Pandit Arjun Lal Sethi, revered as the father of Rajasthan's freedom
          movement, was a visionary revolutionary and educator from Jaipur. He
          founded the Congress Party in Rajasthan and the Jaipur Praja Mandal,
          laying the groundwork for political activism in the region. His
          unwavering commitment to India's independence led to multiple
          imprisonments, during which he endured severe hardships, including a
          70-day fast in protest. Sethi's dedication and sacrifices remain a
          testament to his pivotal role in India's struggle for freedom.

        <p>
          Thakur Kesari Singh Barhath, known as "Rajasthan Kesari," was a
          distinguished revolutionary leader and poet. He fervently opposed

          "Chetavani ra Chungatya," inspired nationalist sentiments. His legacy
